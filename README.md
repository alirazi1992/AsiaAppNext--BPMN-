## BPMN Integration Overview

Inside the `lib/` directory, you'll find the core BPMN logic, including:

- Initialization of BPMN modeler/editor (e.g., `bpmn-js`)

- Functions to load/save BPMN diagrams in XML

- Custom tooling or extensions (palette additions, custom shapes)

The main `app/page.tsx` likely includes a BPMN canvas where users can interact with process diagrams..

---
## Potential Enhancements

- Persist BPMN diagrams using REST API (e.g., call to your backend)

- Add draggable task creation or properties panel

- Export BPMN models as XML or image (PNG/SVG)

- Apply version tracking or collaboration features for diagrams
